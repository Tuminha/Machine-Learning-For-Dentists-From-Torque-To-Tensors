# Chapter 02 - Data for Clinical Questions

> Book: Machine Learning For Dentists: From Torque To Tensors

---

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of data in machine learning:
- What is tabular data vs. images vs. text?
- What are features (predictors) and targets (outcomes)?
- How do we split data for training and testing?
- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- [ ] Understand the difference between features and targets
- [ ] Know when to use supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- [ ] Be able to properly split data into train/test sets
- [ ] Recognize common data quality issues

## Dataset Used

- **D1**: Core tabular dental dataset (introduction)
- **D2**: Toy dataset for simple examples

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Clinical Analogy |
|---------|------------------|
| Features | Patient history, measurements, symptoms |
| Target | Diagnosis or outcome you want to predict |
| Training data | Cases you learn from |
| Test data | New cases to evaluate your learning |
