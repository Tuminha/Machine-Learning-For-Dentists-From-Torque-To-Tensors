# Chapter 14 - Dimensionality Reduction

> Book: Machine Learning For Dentists: From Torque To Tensors

---

## Overview

Dimensionality reduction simplifies complex data. This chapter covers:
- Why reduce dimensions?
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Visualization with t-SNE and UMAP
- When to use each technique

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- [ ] Understand the curse of dimensionality
- [ ] Know how PCA extracts principal components
- [ ] Be able to visualize high-dimensional data
- [ ] Choose between PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP

## Dataset Used

- **D1**: Core tabular dental dataset
- Useful for visualization and preprocessing

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dimension | Number of features |
| Principal component | Direction of maximum variance |
| Explained variance | How much info is retained |
| t-SNE/UMAP | Non-linear methods for visualization |

## Clinical Relevance

Dimensionality reduction helps with:
- Visualizing patient populations
- Reducing noise in many-feature datasets
- Preprocessing before other algorithms
- Understanding feature relationships
