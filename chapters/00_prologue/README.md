# Prologue — The King, the Wizard, and the Price of Prediction

> **Book**: Machine Learning For Dentists: From Torque To Tensors

---

## 📖 Overview

This prologue sets the philosophical foundation for the entire book through a timeless parable about a king who paid his kingdom twice — once to know his fate, once to forget it.

**The core message:** A prediction is not a prophecy. It's information — and its value depends on what you do with it.

## 🎯 What You'll Take Away

- **Prediction is a tool, not a verdict** — the most important lesson of machine learning
- Dentists have always been predictive modelers — we just built our models in our heads
- ML doesn't change *what* we do; it amplifies *how precisely* we can do it
- The author's motivation for writing this book

> *"A prediction is not a prophecy. It's not fate revealed. It's information — a probability, a pattern, a signal extracted from noise. And the value of that information depends entirely on what you do with it."*
