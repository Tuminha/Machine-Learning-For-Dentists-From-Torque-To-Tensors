# Chapter 16 - Text and NLP: From Words To Embeddings and LLMs

> Book: Machine Learning For Dentists: From Torque To Tensors

---

## Overview

This chapter introduces natural language processing for clinical text. It covers:
- Text preprocessing basics
- Bag of words and TF-IDF
- Word embeddings
- Introduction to transformers and LLMs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- [ ] Understand basic text preprocessing
- [ ] Know how to convert text to numbers (vectorization)
- [ ] Have intuition for word embeddings
- [ ] See how LLMs fit into the picture

## Dataset Used

- **D4**: Text dataset (clinical notes or abstracts)
- Classification or information extraction tasks

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tokenization | Breaking text into words/pieces |
| Bag of Words | Count-based representation |
| TF-IDF | Weighted word importance |
| Embedding | Dense vector capturing meaning |
| LLM | Large Language Model (GPT, Claude, etc.) |

## Clinical Relevance

Text analysis in dentistry:
- Extracting information from clinical notes
- Classifying patient complaints
- Summarizing research literature
- Chatbots for patient questions

## Codelab
