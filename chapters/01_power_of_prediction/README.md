# Chapter 01 — The Power of Prediction

> **Book**: Machine Learning For Dentists: From Torque To Tensors

---

## 📖 Overview

This chapter sets the philosophical foundation for the entire book through a timeless parable about a king who paid his kingdom twice — once to know his fate, once to forget it.

**The core message:** A prediction is not a prophecy. It's information — and its value depends on what you do with it.

> *"A prediction is not a prophecy. It's not fate revealed. It's information — a probability, a pattern, a signal extracted from noise. And the value of that information depends entirely on what you do with it."*
